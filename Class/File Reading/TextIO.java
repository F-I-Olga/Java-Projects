		//1. Let's start with something we've done over and over
		//Scanner reader = new Scanner(System.in); //What is this line?
		//System.out.println(reader.nextInt());
		
		//2. Do a quick online search and see what other scanner options are available
		//Pay close attention to the "type" the scanner constructor is expecting
		//What methods are associated with "File" objects?
		
		//3. Copy the Maze1.txt from the file reader lab and put in the same folder as your class file.
		//4. Comment out the above code.
		//5. Create a scanner that will read in from the file instead of the command line
		//What error message do you get? How do we fix this?
	
		//6. Scan the available scanner methods. What can we use to keep reading until the end?
		//7. Set this up using nextInt and watch what happens. 
		//What do you have to know to read the file successfully? Why is this so important?
		
		//8. What "next" options do you have? Choose the most generic one that returns an "string."
		
		//9. Close the above scanner. What does this do?
