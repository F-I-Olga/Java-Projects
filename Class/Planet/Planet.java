//A planet object

//4. We want to inherit from CelestialBody, and implement PlanetCalculations
public class Planet
{
	//planets should have gravity
	public double gravity;
	
	//make a no argument and a single String argument constructor
	public Planet(){name = null; coordinates = 0.0; gravity = 0;}
	
	//5. make a string argument constructor that accepts the name of a planet 
	//sets gravity based on a constant from the interface
	
	
	//6. What method(s) does the interface force us to create?
	//implement that
	
	//7. What methods does the abstract class force. 
	//implement them
